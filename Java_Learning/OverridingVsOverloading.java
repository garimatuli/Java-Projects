/*The most basic difference is that overloading is done in the same class while for overriding base and child classes are required.
Overriding is all about giving a specific implementation to the inherited method of parent class.*/

/* Overriding means having two methods with the same method name and parameters (i.e., method signature).
One of the methods is in the parent class and the other is in the child class.
Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.
*/

// Overriding is a run-time concept while overloading is a compile-time concept.
/* The real object type in the run-time, not the reference variable's type, determines which overridden method is used at runtime.
In contrast, reference type determines which overloaded method will be used at compile time. */

// Overloading is known as compile-time polymorphism.
// Overriding is known as runtime polymorphismâ€‹.
